The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values


Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

*/

// Literals

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals: // 10.00, 1001

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes: // "Priyanshu"



Keyword

for example, let is only used to declare a variable




// JavaScript Identifiers / Names 


Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)



All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 

The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:



JavaScript and Camel Case
Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Hyphens:

first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.   //  Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

Underscore:

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

Lower Camel Case:

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
