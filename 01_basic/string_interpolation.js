// Template Strings use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string:

let text = `Hello World!`;

// Template Strings allow both single and double quotes inside a string:


let text1 = `He's often called "Johnny"`;

/*
Interpolation
Template String provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.

The method is called string interpolation.

The syntax is:

${...}

*/


let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

let text2 = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`;
